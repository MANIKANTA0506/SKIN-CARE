                    <h2>Coconut Oil</h2>
                    <p>Coconut Oil
                        Benefits:<br> Hydration, anti-inflammatory. There's growing science supporting the use of this plant fat as a topical skin soother. Recent research shows that extra virgin coconut oil suppresses some of the body's natural inflammatory agents while making the skin a better barrier. "Many people love coconut oil products to help fight dry, itchy skin and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis," says Laurel Naversen Geraghty, MD, a dermatologist in Medford, OR. "Some of my psoriasis patients swear by overnight coconut oil scalp treatments worn under a plastic shower cap." But Geraghty warns against putting coconut oil on blemish-prone areas because it may worsen acne. Find it in jars in the cooking aisle</p>

                    <p>Green Tea
                        Benefits: <br>Sun protection, anti-aging. The connection between drinking green tea and improved health has been suggested for years, but it may also help to use the plant on the skin. "Green tea has good results in terms of photoprotection and anti-aging benefits," says Jeanine Downie, a dermatologist in Montclair, NJ. The polyphenols in green tea have antioxidant properties as well as soothing abilities that help treat sun-damaged skin and offer a way to address the signs of sun damage, she says. Find it in tea you can drink as well as some sunscreen.</p>
