                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                    <p>Clogged hair follicles or pores cause acne.Your hair follicles are small tubes that hold a strand of your hair. There are several glands that empty into your hair follicles. When too much material is inside your hair follicle, a clog occurs. Your pores can clog with:

                      <br>  Sebum: An oily substance that provides a protective barrier for your skin.
                       <br> Bacteria: Small amounts of bacteria naturally live on your skin. If you have too much bacteria, it can clog your pores.
                       <br> Dead skin cells: Your skin cells shed often to make room for more cells to grow. When your skin releases dead skin cells, they can get stuck in your hair follicles.
                        When your pores clog, substances plug up your hair follicle, creating a pimple. This triggers inflammation, which you feel as pain and swelling. You can also see inflammation through skin discoloration like redness around a pimple.</p>
