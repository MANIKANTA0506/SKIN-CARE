                        You probably already know that cleansing means washing your face and moisturizing means hydrating your skin, but what does "treating" involve? Well, in addition to keeping your complexion in great shape, the goal of any skincare routine is to target problem areas. Treating means incorporating serums packed full of beneficial skincare ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, alpha hydroxy acids and others, depending on your skin type and the results you want to see. "Adding a middle step in between the cleansing and moisturizing components is really important," Dr. Magovern says.

                    <p>The best face wash formulas will gently cleanse your skin without stripping it of healthy oils. “A [good] sulfate- and soap-free cleanser for the face will be pH-balanced and gentle to maintain the skin’s barrier without stripping,” says Whitney Bowe, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City and author of The Beauty of Dirty Skin. For everyday cleansing, here's how to choose a face cleanser based on your skin type:

                        Oily skin: A foaming or gel cleanser will ensure adequate removal of dirt and oil from your skin; ingredients like niacinamide and salicylic acid can help regulate and remove excess oil.
                        Acne-prone skin: A foaming cleanser with acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid, glycolic acid, benzoyl peroxide or sulfur is your best bet.
                        Dry skin: Look for a lotion, cream, oil or balm formula that contains hydrating ingredients like ceramides, glycerin, hyaluronic acid and botanical oils.
                        Sensitive skin: Try a gentle fragrance-free formula or a micellar water, a mild cleanser that includes tiny particles called micelles that trap impurities and lift them away without dehydrating skin</p>
