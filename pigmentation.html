The three leading causes of skin pigmentation are genetics, sun exposure, and particular medications. Understanding the fundamental causes of skin pigmentation will help us understand how to treat and prevent itA major cause of facial pigmentation is fluctuations in specific hormones in your body during puberty or pregnancy. Activities like consuming contraceptive pills might also cause hormonal changes, which can wreck the skin and lead to melanin production. Such disruption in hormonal balance will lead to hyperpigmentation like melasma, which features greyish and brown patches on the skin.</p>

                        Sunscreen will help prevent dark spots, sun spots, or pigmentation caused by sun rays by shielding against damaging UV rays.
